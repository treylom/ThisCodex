# rule-router.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook (Layer 1 enforcement; see docs/rules-system.md
#   "Enforcement: when the self-check gets skipped").
#
# Reads the prompt, matches task-type keywords, and force-surfaces the matching rule's
# core gate from rules/INDEX.md — so that a *skipped* INDEX self-check still applies.
# The mapping keys off task-types (it mirrors INDEX triggers; it does NOT duplicate rule bodies).
# Complementary to a static always-on self-check (which gets tuned out by being identical
# every turn) — this one is situation-matched, so it is relevant and hard to ignore.
#
# fail-open: no jq / empty prompt / no keyword match → emit nothing, exit 0. Never blocks.
#
# Register (~/.codex/hooks.json) under UserPromptSubmit, then trust via the Codex
# /hooks flow — see README §3.6 / the setup skill (a wired-but-untrusted hook is
# silently inactive):
#   {"type":"command","command":"bash <bundle>/hooks/rule-router.sh","timeout":3}
